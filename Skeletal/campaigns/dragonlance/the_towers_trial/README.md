**This isn't a static module you read aloud.** The Tower's Trial is designed from the ground up for AI Dungeon Masters, delivering an experience that rivals a veteran human DM.

### What the AI Renders On-the-Fly

🎨 **Dynamic Visual Art** — Watch the story unfold visually with procedurally generated scene illustrations, tactical combat maps, and atmospheric location art rendered in real-time as you play.

🎭 **Emergent Storytelling** — Story Gates define objectives, not scripts. The AI generates authentic dialogue, environmental details, and NPC reactions based on your specific choices and party composition. No two playthroughs are alike.

- **Authentic character voices** rendered from training knowledge of the source material
- **Reactive NPCs** who remember your choices and adjust their behavior
- **Dynamic difficulty** that scales to your party's performance  
- **Procedural detail** that makes every playthrough feel fresh
- **Instant rulings** using full D&D 5e knowledge—no rulebook lookups

**Compatible with:** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any AI capable of following structured prompts. Just load the campaign file and play.

## 📖 The Story

A wizard's governing body has declared a trial: retrieve five **Tokens of Dominion** from five chromatic dragon lords to prove yourself worthy of claiming the greatest magical tower—the most powerful stronghold remaining.

But you're not alone. A rival dark-robed wizard has already begun the hunt. And with each Token claimed, an ancient, malevolent presence grows stronger, whispering temptations of ultimate power.

Meanwhile, your companions struggle to save both the world and your soul.

### The Quest

| Token | Dragon | Location | Levels |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| ⚪ **Shard of Winter's Heart** | Adult White | Frozen Glacier | 5-7 |
| ⚫ **The Venom Chalice** | Adult Black | Endless Swamps | 7-9 |
| 🟢 **The Emerald Eye** | Adult Green | Nightmare Forest | 9-11 |
| 🔵 **The Stormcaller's Horn** | Adult Blue | Storm Fortress | 11-13 |
| 🔴 **The Heart of the Inferno** | Ancient Red | Volcanic Caldera | 13-15 |

Each Token grants power... and demands a price.

## 🎮 What Makes This Special?

### 🔥 Meaningful Choices

Your decisions **matter**:
- Will you sacrifice allies for power?
- Will you join the dragon armies for safety?
- Will you accept dark bargains when all seems lost?
- Can you resist corruption when ambition beckons?

Every choice affects your **Corruption Meter** (0-100), determining NPC reactions, available options, and which of six endings you'll experience.

### 🌟 Six Unique Endings

- **Bittersweet** (26-50): Victory at terrible personal cost
- **Tragic Victory** (51-75): Power gained, humanity lost
- **Consumed** (100): The darkness wins—you are lost
- **Rejection** (Any): Destroy the Tokens, choose another path
- **Sacrifice** (Any): Use power for something greater

### 🐲 Legendary Dragon Battles

Five chromatic dragons, each with unique personalities, tactics, and lair actions. The Ancient Red Dragon finale is designed to feel nearly impossible—pushing you to use every resource and ally.

### 🌙 Source-Authentic Mechanics

- **Moon Magic**: Three moons wax and wane, affecting spellcasters
- **Dragon-Soldier Foes**: Unique death effects (turn to stone, explode, dissolve)

Every playthrough differs based on:

- **Rival wizard arc** — Your choices determine if they become nemesis, ally, or tragic mirror
- **AI generation** — Dialogue, descriptions, and encounters are never identical twice

**Six endings × multiple characters × faction permutations × emergent AI storytelling = campaigns you can run again and again.**

## 📜 Design Philosophy

### Skeletal Campaign Framework

This campaign uses the **Skeletal DM Kernel** approach:

- **Story Gates** define objectives, not scripts—the AI generates the journey
- **Archetype Pointers** let AI render authentic characters from training knowledge
- **Emergent narrative** based on player choices, not pre-written boxed text
- **Modular structure** that's easy to modify or extend

### Why "Skeletal"?

Traditional modules are **complete skeletons with flesh attached**—every room described, every NPC voiced, every encounter scripted. You read what's written.

Skeletal campaigns are **bones only**. The AI adds the flesh in real-time:
- Gate says "confront the dragon" → AI generates the confrontation
- Archetype says "grumpy dwarf veteran" → AI renders the authentic character
- Corruption hits 50 → AI shifts NPC reactions accordingly

**Result:** The structure ensures story coherence. The AI ensures every moment feels alive.

### Archetype Pointer System

The campaign uses **archetype pointers** instead of copyrighted content:

```yaml
PROTAGONIST_WIZARD:
  archetype: "The frail, ambitious twin wizard from source material"
  canonical_rendering: "Exactly as portrayed in Chronicles/Legends"
```

The AI resolves `PROTAGONIST_WIZARD` to the authentic character using its training knowledge. The campaign file stays clean; the experience stays authentic.
