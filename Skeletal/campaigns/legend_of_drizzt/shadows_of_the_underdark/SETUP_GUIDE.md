## 🗺️ Act-by-Act GM Notes

### Act 1: The Fall (Levels 3-4)

**Tone**: Desperate escape, culture shock, first survival

**Key Story Gates:**
1. **Gate 1.1 - The Destruction**: Open with visceral action. House Despana burns. Immediate danger. No time for long exposition.
2. **Gate 1.2 - First Survival**: Teach Underdark survival. Food/water scarcity. Pursuit encounters. Make rest dangerous.
3. **Gate 1.3 - First Contact**: Introduce faction system. First non-drow encounter shapes early reputation.

**Pacing Tips:**
- Session 1 should cover Gate 1.1 entirely
- Gates 1.2 and 1.3 can span 2-3 sessions
- Don't rush survival - make the Underdark feel deadly

**Common Encounters (CR 1-3):**
- Drow pursuit teams (2-4 warriors + 1 priestess)
- Giant spiders (web ambushes)
- Hook horrors (territorial cave guardians)
- Carrion crawlers, darkmantles, piercers

---

### Act 2: The Wandering (Levels 4-6)

**Tone**: Finding community, identifying greater threat, building alliances

**Key Story Gates:**
1. **Gate 2.1 - The Settlement**: Choose settlement type based on Act 1 faction interactions. Deep gnomes if party helped svirfneblin, duergar if profit-focused, etc.
2. **Gate 2.2 - The Threat**: Introduce major antagonist. Options:
   - **Demogorgon's Madness** (demon lord influence)
   - **Mind Flayer Expansion** (illithid colony growing)
   - **Drow Crusade** (major house conquering the region)
   - **Ancient Aboleth** (awakening in underground lake)
3. **Gate 2.3 - Gathering Strength**: Let players choose approach. Track alliances, resources, and weaknesses discovered.

**Pacing Tips:**
- Settlement should feel like temporary home (2-3 sessions)
- Threat revelation should be gradual, ominous
- Give players agency in how they prepare

**Faction Reputation Ranges:**
- **-5 to -3**: Hostile, will attack or sabotage
- **-2 to +2**: Neutral, cautious interactions
- **+3 to +5**: Friendly, willing to help or trade

---

### Act 3: The Reckoning (Levels 6-8)

**Tone**: Epic confrontation, moral choice, defining moment

**Key Story Gates:**
1. **Gate 3.1 - The Storm Breaks**: Threat forces action. Settlement attacked or ultimatum given.
2. **Gate 3.2 - The Choice**: Present moral dilemma tailored to party's journey:
   - Sacrifice NPC ally for tactical advantage?
   - Use dark magic/Lolth's power to win?
   - Show mercy to defeated enemy?
   - Reveal location of other outcasts to save settlement?
3. **Gate 3.3 - Resolution**: Final battle reflects their choice. Victory can be triumphant, bittersweet, pyrrhic, dark, or lead to surface world.

**Pacing Tips:**
- Gate 3.1 should be urgent, high-stakes
- Gate 3.2 is THE defining moment - make it matter
- Gate 3.3 should feel earned, not arbitrary

**Ending Selection:**
Based on party's choices throughout campaign:
- **Triumphant**: Heroic choices, strong alliances, minimal casualties
- **Bittersweet**: Victory with significant losses or sacrifice
- **Pyrrhic**: Won the battle, lost the community
- **Dark**: Used morally questionable means to achieve victory
- **Surface**: Party chooses to abandon Underdark for surface world

## 💡 AI DM Tips

### Opening Sessions
- **Don't pre-write dialogue** - generate fresh based on player choices
- **Use all senses** - describe darkness through sound, smell, touch
- **Make survival matter** - track rations, water, exhaustion
- **Introduce faction mechanics early** - show reputation in action

### Mid-Campaign
- **Track faction shifts** - adjust NPC behavior based on reputation
- **Telegraph the threat** - drop hints before major revelation
- **Reward creative survival** - let players find clever solutions
- **Balance combat & roleplay** - Salvatore has both fast action and character moments

### Final Sessions
- **Make The Choice personal** - tie it to NPCs they care about
- **Don't pull punches** - Underdark is deadly, victories should be earned
- **Honor their journey** - ending should reflect their decisions
- **Leave threads** - even concluded campaigns can hint at future adventures

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Players are avoiding all faction contact"
- Force contact through resource scarcity (need guide, supplies, shelter)
- Have faction approach them (scouts, refugees, traders)
- Make isolation deadly (increase encounter difficulty)

### "Party wants to skip to surface immediately"
- Allow it, but make journey treacherous (many sessions of travel)
- Surface world brings new problems (sunlight sensitivity, surface prejudice)
- Threat might follow them (demons, mind flayers don't stay in Underdark)

### "Players chose dark path but want triumphant ending"
- Honor their choices - dark means yield dark outcomes
- Offer redemption arc if they recognize and change
- Bittersweet or dark ending can be satisfying if earned

### "Faction reputation is all negative"
- Introduce new faction (outcast community)
- Allow redemption through major action (save settlement, defeat mutual enemy)
- Make them experience consequences (everyone hostile, no safe rest, constant hunted)
