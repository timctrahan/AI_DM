## 🤖 Powered by AI

**This isn't a static module you read aloud.** Shadows of the Underdark is designed from the ground up for AI Dungeon Masters, delivering an experience that captures the brutal beauty of the source material.

### What the AI Renders On-the-Fly

🎨 **Archetype Characters** — Play as legendary companions rendered authentically by AI from source material knowledge. The campaign stores archetype tokens (RENEGADE_DROW_RANGER, DWARVEN_CLAN_LEADER), not copyrighted names—the AI fills in authentic details at runtime.

```yaml
RENEGADE_DROW_RANGER:
  ↓ AI Renders ↓
"A lean drow with panther-like grace wields paired
scimitars in a whirlwind dance. Brooding violet eyes
question everything your corrupt society taught you..."
```

📊 **Live Faction Tracking** — Your reputation with deep gnomes, duergar, drow houses, and outcasts shifts dynamically based on your choices. Show mercy to the wrong people? Drow assassins hunt you. Protect deep gnome miners? Their settlements open to you.

```
📜 FACTION STANDING

🏔️ Deep Gnomes .......... +4 (Welcomed as friends)
⚒️ Duergar ............... +1 (Profitable trade)
🕷️ Drow Houses .......... -5 (HUNTED BY ASSASSINS)
🌑 Outcasts .............. +3 (Found family forms)
```

🌑 **Darkness & Survival** — The AI tracks light sources, darkvision ranges, and encounter chances. Light a torch? Attract deadly attention. Rest in the open? Roll for wandering horrors. The Underdark is always watching.

```
💡 LIGHT STATUS

Party: 2 with darkvision, 3 need light
Torch lit: ENCOUNTER CHANCE +25%
Last safe rest: 18 hours ago
Food remaining: 2 days
Water source: Uncertain (poisoned?)
```

⚔️ **Three-Dimensional Combat** — Tunnels branch up, down, and sideways. The AI renders tactical maps showing elevation, chokepoints, and ambush positions. Spider webs block upper passages. Ropers lurk on ceilings. Hook horrors echo from below.

🕸️ **Faerzress Zones** — Wild magic radiation zones appear unpredictably. Teleportation fails. Divination clouds. Wild magic surges. The AI tracks when you enter these areas and applies effects automatically.

```
⚡ FAERZRESS DETECTED

Zone intensity: MODERATE
Effects active:
- Teleportation 50% failure
- Divination blocked
- Wild magic on spell cast (d20)
```

🎭 **Emergent Storytelling** — Story Gates define objectives, not scripts. The AI generates authentic dialogue, environmental horrors, and NPC reactions based on your specific choices and party composition. Each journey through the Underdark is unique.

### Why AI Changes Everything

Traditional modules give you boxed text to read aloud. **Shadows of the Underdark gives you a framework**, and the AI fills it with:

- **Authentic character voices** rendered from training knowledge of the source material
- **Reactive NPCs** who remember if you saved or betrayed their people
- **Dynamic encounters** that reflect your faction relationships
- **Procedural Underdark** that feels vast, deadly, and alive
- **Instant rulings** using full D&D 5e knowledge—no rulebook lookups

**Compatible with:** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any AI capable of following structured prompts. Just load the campaign file and descend into darkness.

## 📖 The Story

Your noble house is burning. Rival drow have destroyed everything you served, and the city's corrupt authorities will show no mercy. There's only one choice: **flee into the wild Underdark**.

But the depths are deadlier than any drow city. Total darkness. Scarce food and water. Creatures that view you as prey. And if you survive long enough, you'll face an impossible question:

**Who will you become in the darkness? A monster like those you fled? Or something more?**

### The Journey

| Act | Name | Challenge | Levels |
|-----|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **The Fall** | Escape the burning city, survive first contact with the wild Underdark | 3-4 |
| 2 | **The Wandering** | Find refuge, identify the greater threat, gather strength | 4-6 |
| 3 | **The Reckoning** | Face the threat, make the defining choice, determine your fate | 6-8 |

Each act tests not just your survival skills, but your **moral identity**.

---

## 🎮 What Makes This Special?

### 🔥 Survival is Earned

Every basic need is a challenge:
- **Food**: DC 15 to forage edible fungi, cave fish, or insects
- **Water**: DC 12 Nature check to find safe sources (or risk poison)
- **Rest**: Long rests in the open trigger encounters 50% of the time
- **Navigation**: DC 15 Survival to avoid getting lost in three-dimensional tunnels
- **Light**: Attracts danger—but darkvision can't see color or detail

Resources aren't just numbers—they're **dramatic tension**.

### 🕷️ Faction Relationships Matter

Your choices shape how the Underdark's peoples view you:

**Deep Gnomes** (Svirfneblin):
- Protect their miners from drow slavers? +2 reputation
- Lead enemies to their settlements? -4 reputation
- At +5: Welcomed as friends, offered shelter and trade
- At -5: Attacked on sight, barred from all settlements

**Duergar** (Gray Dwarves):
- Profitable trade? +1 reputation
- Cheat them in deals? -3 reputation
- At +5: Mercenary alliance available
- At -5: Enslaved if captured

**Drow Noble Houses**:
- Show mercy publicly? -2 reputation
- Reject Lolth entirely? -5 reputation (HUNTED)
- At +5: Offered alliance (with strings attached)
- At -5: House assassins dispatched to kill you

**The Outcasts**:
- Prove you've rejected Lolth? +2 reputation
- Work with drow houses against them? -3 reputation
- At +5: Found family bonds form
- At -5: They abandon you to hunters

### 🌟 Five Unique Endings

- **Triumphant**: Threat defeated, community saved, you've proven drow can choose differently
- **Bittersweet**: Victory at great cost—someone or something irreplaceable is lost
- **Pyrrhic**: Threat defeated but community destroyed—you must start over
- **Dark**: Victory through dark means—you've become something troubling
- **Surface**: You choose to seek the surface world—a new story begins

### 🌑 Source-Authentic Mechanics

- **Total Darkness**: Default environment, darkvision required or light sources needed
- **Faerzress Radiation**: Wild magic zones block divination and disrupt teleportation
- **Drow Society**: Matriarchal hierarchy, Lolth worship, constant scheming
- **Three-Dimensional Navigation**: Tunnels go up, down, and sideways
- **Faction Reputation**: Deep gnomes, duergar, drow houses, outcasts—all trackable

### 👥 Your Heroes

**Play as Iconic Archetypes:**
Experience the campaign as legendary outcasts from the source material—the renegade drow ranger with paired scimitars, the gruff dwarf clan leader, the fierce archer raised by dwarves, the young northern barbarian, or the comfort-loving halfling rogue with hidden courage.

All pre-built at level 3, or **create your own custom party** of outcasts fleeing corruption.

## 🔄 Infinite Replayability

Every playthrough differs based on:

- **Character choice** — Each archetype experiences the Underdark differently
- **Faction paths** — Allied with deep gnomes? Duergar become hostile. Rejected Lolth? All drow hunt you.
- **Settlement type** — Deep gnome village? Duergar trading post? Myconid grove? Outcast hideaway? Each offers different story branches.
- **Threat type** — Demon lord influence? Mind flayer colony? Drow crusade? Ancient aboleth? Each final act plays differently.
- **Moral choices** — Show mercy or cruelty? Build alliances or betray? Each choice ripples through the narrative.
- **AI generation** — Dialogue, encounters, and Underdark hazards are never identical twice

**Five endings × multiple characters × faction permutations × threat variations × emergent AI storytelling = campaigns you can run again and again.**

Years later, players will remember:

- 🔥 The moment their house burned and flight was the only option
- ⚔️ First encounter with non-drow Underdark denizens—violence or parley?
- 💔 When showing mercy cost them dearly
- 🕷️ The drow assassin squad hunting them through Faerzress zones
- 🏔️ Finding sanctuary with deep gnomes after proving trustworthy

This isn't just a campaign about escaping the Underdark. It's about **who you become** when everything is stripped away.

## 📜 Design Philosophy

### Skeletal Campaign Framework

This campaign uses the **Skeletal DM Kernel** approach:

- **Story Gates** define objectives, not scripts—the AI generates the journey
- **Archetype Pointers** let AI render authentic characters from training knowledge
- **Emergent narrative** based on player choices, not pre-written boxed text
- **Modular structure** that's easy to modify or extend

### Why "Skeletal"?

Traditional modules are **complete skeletons with flesh attached**—every room described, every NPC voiced, every encounter scripted. You read what's written.

Skeletal campaigns are **bones only**. The AI adds the flesh in real-time:
- Gate says "escape burning city" → AI generates the escape sequence
- Archetype says "renegade drow ranger" → AI renders the authentic character
- Faction reputation hits +5 → AI shifts NPC behavior accordingly

**Result:** The structure ensures story coherence. The AI ensures every moment feels alive.

### Archetype Pointer System (IP-Clean)

The campaign uses **archetype pointers** instead of copyrighted content:

```yaml
RENEGADE_DROW_RANGER:
  archetype_token: "RENEGADE_DROW_RANGER"
  render_from_source: "Iconic drow ranger from source material"
  render_directive: "AI renders appearance, voice, mannerisms from training knowledge"
```

The AI resolves `RENEGADE_DROW_RANGER` to the authentic character using its training knowledge. **The campaign file stays clean; the experience stays authentic.**

**Result**: Zero copyrighted content stored, but players experience the legendary characters exactly as they should be.
