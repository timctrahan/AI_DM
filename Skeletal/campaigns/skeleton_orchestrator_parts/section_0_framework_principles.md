# SECTION 0: FRAMEWORK PRINCIPLES

## Core Thesis

**Old Model (Comprehensive):** Campaign file specifies 80% of narrative content
- Result: DM agent pattern-matches, loses responsiveness, breaks when party deviates
- Problem: Feels less like playing D&D and more like reading flowcharts

**New Model (Skeletal):** Campaign file specifies 20% (rules + skeleton + feedback loops)
- Result: DM agent must reason, ask clarifying questions, discover consequences
- Benefit: More dynamic, responsive, player-driven gameplay emerges naturally

## Design Constraints

1. **No pre-written dialogue** - Only character motivations and personality templates
2. **No location descriptions** - Only mechanical function and what can be there
3. **No quest branches** - Only faction goals and consequence triggers
4. **No encounter stat blocks** - Only difficulty guidelines and enemy *types* (not specifics)
5. **No predetermined outcomes** - Only what changes the world based on choices

## What We KEEP Specified

1. **World Rules** - How the setting actually works (magic system, faction mechanics, economy)
2. **Feedback Loops** - Explicit reputation math, consequence triggers, state changes
3. **Character Templates** - Motivations, goals, constraints (but not dialogue)
4. **Encounter Types** - "This situation spawns X difficulty challenge" (not detailed encounters)
5. **Decision Points** - Explicit moments where DM MUST stop and ask player for input
