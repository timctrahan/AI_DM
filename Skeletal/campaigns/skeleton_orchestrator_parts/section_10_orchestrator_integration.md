# SECTION 10: ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION

This skeletal structure integrates with the D&D 5E Orchestrator:

**Decision Point Protocol stays the same:**
- Present numbered options
- End with question
- ⛔ STOP, WAIT for input
- Execute only chosen action

**Ambient Context Weaving becomes CRITICAL:**
- NOT optional for skeletal campaigns
- Surface reputation scores naturally
- Weave world state into narration
- Rotate what context gets highlighted (use TIER 0-4 framework)
- Validate all state before every output
- Surface consequences of recent decisions

**What changes:**
- No consultation of pre-written branches
- No "running" predetermined encounters
- Reasoning happens in real-time from rules + world state
- Consequences emerge from reputation math + faction logic
- NPCs act from motivation + current circumstances, not scripts
- **CRITICAL:** Context weaving prevents world from becoming incoherent

**The dependency chain:**
```
Skeletal Campaign Structure
    ↓
Requires reasoning from rules/feedback loops (no rails)
    ↓
Requires accurate state tracking (no narratives to hide inconsistency)
    ↓
Requires hyperactive context weaving (constantly surface state)
    ↓
Result: Game stays coherent while remaining emergent
```

Without context weaving, skeletal campaigns fail. This is load-bearing.
