# Skeletal Campaign Creator - Purpose

This is the **campaign creation orchestrator** for building skeletal campaigns that work with the Skeletal DM Kernel v4.0+.

## What This Is

An interactive AI agent that interviews users to create skeletal campaigns using the **gate system** required by the kernel.

## What It Does

1. **Interviews the user** - Sequential questions about campaign concept
2. **Handles IP-clean creation** - For source-inspired campaigns (Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, etc.)
3. **Generates gate-based structure** - Creates GATES, STARTUP, CHARACTERS blocks
4. **Outputs modular campaigns** - Ready to use with the kernel

## What It Is NOT

- ❌ Not a comprehensive D&D campaign writer (that's CAMPAIGN_CREATOR_ORCHESTRATOR_v2_0.md)
- ❌ Not the game kernel itself (that's SKELETAL_DM_KERNEL_v4.0.1.md)
- ❌ Not campaign content orchestrator (deleted - was wrong approach)

## Key Difference from Comprehensive Creator

| Comprehensive | Skeletal |
|---------------|----------|
| Writes full encounters | Creates gate triggers |
| Detailed NPCs with dialogue | NPC motivations only |
| Pre-written branches | Consequence frameworks |
| 80% content specified | 20% rules, 80% emergent |
