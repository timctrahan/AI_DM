# SKELETAL CAMPAIGN ORCHESTRATOR v1.0

**Design Philosophy:** Minimal specification, maximum emergent gameplay. This orchestrator provides the *rules* and *feedback loops* of a campaign world, not the *narrative*. The DM agent must reason within constraints, not execute predetermined branches.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL DEPENDENCY: CONTEXT WEAVING

**This is not optional.** Skeletal campaigns REQUIRE hyperactive context weaving or they collapse into incoherence.

## Why Context Weaving is Load-Bearing

Comprehensive campaigns hide state in pre-written branches. Skeletal campaigns have no safety net.

If the DM agent loses track of:
- What reputation gate was triggered 3 sessions ago
- Which NPC's motivations shifted based on party choices
- What world state changed from a decision
- How faction interactions cascaded

...the game becomes broken. It devolves into reasoning about "what makes sense now" without actually knowing what *became true*.

**Solution:** Weaponized context weaving that surfaces state constantly.
