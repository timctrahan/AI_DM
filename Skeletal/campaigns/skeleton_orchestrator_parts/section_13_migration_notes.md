# SECTION 13: MIGRATION NOTES

**Converting from Comprehensive Campaign File:**
1. Delete all pre-written dialogue
2. Delete all detailed location descriptions (keep mechanical function only)
3. Delete all quest branches
4. Delete all encounter stat blocks (keep difficulty + role descriptions)
5. Extract NPC motivation/constraint/goal into templates
6. Extract faction goals into reputation math
7. Identify decision points and consequence chains
8. Build feedback loops explicitly

**Result:** Campaign shrinks from 1,800 lines to 300-500 lines. Much more playable.
