# SECTION 4: ENCOUNTER FRAMEWORK (Not Stat Blocks)

## Encounter Trigger Template

```yaml
situation_name: [What is this encounter?]
trigger_condition: [When does this encounter activate?]
difficulty_rating: [Easy/Medium/Hard/Deadly]

enemy_composition:
  - [Type 1]: [Description of role, NOT stats. E.g., "Ranged attackers"]
  - [Type 2]: [Description of role]

environment:
  terrain: [What's the layout?]
  hazards: [What can hurt/help?]
  escape_routes: [How can this end without total death?]

resolution_outcomes:
  party_victory: [What happens if party wins? What changes?]
  party_defeat: [What happens if party loses? What changes?]
  party_negotiates: [Can this be avoided? What would it cost?]

```

## Encounter Difficulty Guidelines

**Easy:** Party should win easily without resource expenditure
**Medium:** Party uses some resources, gets scratched but fine
**Hard:** Party uses significant resources, maybe 1 character drops
**Deadly:** Party might lose, should flee/negotiate, not guaranteed victory
