# SECTION 8: DM REASONING FRAMEWORK

When party does something unexpected:

1. **Check faction motivations** - How would each faction react?
2. **Check reputation gates** - What becomes available/hostile?
3. **Check story flags** - Does this change anything?
4. **Apply reputation math** - What's the consequence?
5. **Update world state** - What becomes true now?
6. **Present outcome** - Tell player what they see/hear

**Never consult a pre-written branch.** Reason from first principles.
