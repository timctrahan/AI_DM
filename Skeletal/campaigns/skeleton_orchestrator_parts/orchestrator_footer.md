# FILE METADATA

```yaml
document_name: "Skeletal_Campaign_Orchestrator_v1_0.md"
version: 1.0
status: TEMPLATE_READY
purpose: "Framework for creating campaign files that enable AI reasoning instead of narrative execution"

design_principles:
  - Minimal specification (20% detail, 80% emergent)
  - Explicit feedback loops (reputation math, consequence chains)
  - Intentional gaps (force reasoning over pattern-matching)
  - Rule-based world (faction motivations, not predetermined outcomes)
  - Hyperactive context weaving (load-bearing dependency)

critical_dependencies:
  context_weaving: "MANDATORY - Without it, game loses coherence"
  reputation_tracking: "MANDATORY - Core to all decisions"
  world_state_validation: "MANDATORY - Before every DM output"
  consequence_surfacing: "MANDATORY - Tie every narration to past decisions"

integration:
  compatible_with: "CORE_DND5E_AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR_v6_8_0"
  required_protocols: "Player Agency, Decision Point Framework, Ambient Context Weaving (TIER 0-4)"

usage_ready: true

notes:
  - "This framework prioritizes coherence through aggressive state tracking"
  - "Skeletal design only works if context weaving is hyperactive"
  - "Validate all state before every output or world becomes incoherent"
  - "No safety net: every consequence must be traced and surfaced"
```
