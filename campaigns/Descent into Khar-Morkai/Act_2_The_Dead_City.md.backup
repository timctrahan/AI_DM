## 📖 ACT OVERVIEW

### **Story Summary**

Inside **Khar-Morkai**, the party navigates a vast necropolis spanning miles. Tomb-districts stretch in all directions, each holding dangers, treasures, and fragments of the terrible truth. The central spire pulses with sickly green light—the Vault of Souls calls to them through nightmares.

To reach the Vault, the party must discover **three Key Fragments** hidden in different districts:
1. **The Soulforge Shard** (Artisan Quarter - where dwarven smiths once worked)
2. **The Warden's Sigil** (Temple District - where priests performed the binding)
3. **The Mourner's Tear** (Memorial Gardens - where families said goodbye)

But they're not alone. **House Shadowveil** (drow) hunts Velryn. **Aberrant Devourer scouts** investigate the weakening seal. And the **undead of Khar-Morkai** grow more aggressive as the party disturbs ancient rest.

Every choice costs something. Every victory leaves scars.

### **Key Themes**
- **Moral corruption:** Good choices have bad outcomes
- **Lesser evils:** Sometimes there's no right answer
- **Weight of ancient sins:** Understanding the dwarves' choice
- **Faction collision:** Multiple powers converge on the Vault

### **Act Goals**
1. Discover all three Vault Key Fragments
2. Piece together the full story of the soul binding
3. Survive faction encounters (drow, Aberrant Devourers)
4. Test companion loyalty (Velryn's past confronted)
5. Reach the Vault's outer sanctum

## 🎯 MAIN QUEST CHAIN

### **MAIN QUEST 1: Mapping the Dead**
**Orientation & Exploration | 1200 XP | Sessions 1-2**

#### Quest Summary

Khar-Morkai is enormous—miles of winding streets, thousands of tomb-buildings, and the central spire looming in the distance. The party must explore and establish safe routes before diving deeper.

**This quest introduces Khar-Morkai's geography and establishes key locations.**

#### Key Mechanics

**Exploration System:**
- Party can explore 1 district per session
- Each district has: encounters, loot, lore, possible key fragment
- Nightmare intensity increases with time spent

**Available Districts (Choose exploration order):**
1. Merchant Quarter (safest, basic supplies)
2. Artisan Quarter (Soulforge Shard location)
3. Temple District (Warden's Sigil location)
4. Memorial Gardens (Mourner's Tear location)
5. Noble Estates (dangerous, rich loot)
6. Catacombs (very dangerous, connects all districts)

#### Initial Encounter: The Welcome

**Encounter: Undead Patrol**
- **Setup:** As party enters main street, undead sentinels approach
- **Enemies:** 4x Ghoul (CR 1, 200 XP each) + 1x Ghast (CR 2, 450 XP)
- **Adjusted XP:** (800 + 450) × 2 = 2,500 XP (Hard for 4 Level 5 PCs)
- **Tactics:** Ghouls swarm, ghast commands, aim for paralysis
- **Environment:** Narrow street (10ft wide), tomb doors provide cover

**If Parleyed with Sentinel Korag (Act 1):**
- Undead stand down but watch suspiciously
- Ghast leader: "Korag said you may pass. We do not trust you."
- Reputation: khar_morkai_undead +0 (neutral, not hostile)

**If Fought Past Gates:**
- Undead attack on sight
- Reputation: khar_morkai_undead -5 (hostile throughout act)

#### Quest Branches: Establishing Base

**Option A: Merchant Quarter Haven**
- Find abandoned merchant guild hall
- Structurally sound, defensible
- Close to surface (easier retreat)
- **Safe rest location established**

**Option B: Temple District Sanctuary**
- Desecrated temple, holy ground weakened but present
- Undead avoid area (less harassment)
- Central location (faster travel)
- **Safe rest with bonus: undead won't ambush here**

**Option C: No Fixed Base (Mobile)**
- Party stays mobile, camps in different locations
- Harder to find (stealth advantage)
- No guaranteed safety (random encounters during rests)

#### Discovery: The Vault Requires Keys

**Lore Encounter:** Party finds dwarven journal in ruins

> "Day 1,473 since the Binding. The Vault holds. Three keys were forged to prevent accidental opening: The Soulforge Shard (so none may replicate the binding), the Warden's Sigil (so none may command the souls), and the Mourner's Tear (so none may forget the cost). Without all three, the Vault cannot open. May Moradin forgive us." — Priest Thoran Ironheart

**Party now knows:**
- Three key fragments exist
- Approximate locations (districts named)
- Opening the Vault = releasing or controlling souls

#### Random District Encounters (Roll 1d6 per district explored)

1. **Restless Spirits:** 3x Specter (CR 1, 200 XP each) - can negotiate
2. **Scavenger Ghouls:** 5x Ghoul (CR 1, 200 XP each) - feeding on corpses
3. **Collapsing Architecture:** Dex save DC 14 or 3d6 bludgeoning damage
4. **Drow Scouts:** Evidence of drow presence (tracks, campsites) - no combat yet
5. **Aberrant Devourer Signs:** Thralls (Blind Savages) on patrol - foreshadowing
6. **Ancient Treasure:** Find 1d4 × 100gp worth of dwarven artifacts

#### Quest Completion

**Success Conditions:**
- Explored 2+ districts
- Established base or travel plan
- Learned about three key fragments
- Survived initial encounters

**Rewards:**
- 1200 XP (split among party)
- Safe rest location (if chosen)
- District map knowledge
- Key fragment hints

**World State Changes:**
```yaml
flags_set:
  - khar_morkai_explored: true
  - base_established: [merchant/temple/mobile/none]
  - districts_visited: [list]
  - vault_keys_known: true

### **MAIN QUEST 2: The Three Key Fragments**
**Multi-Part Collection | 4500 XP total | Sessions 3-6**

**This quest is three sub-quests, one per key fragment. Party can attempt in any order.**

---

#### **FRAGMENT 1: The Soulforge Shard**
**Location: Artisan Quarter | 1500 XP**

**Summary:** The Soulforge was where dwarven smiths created the soul-binding mechanism. The Shard is hidden in the master forge, now haunted by the ghost of its creator.

**Location Details:**

**The Master Forge**
- Architecture: Massive underground foundry, cold forges, rusted anvils
- Atmosphere: Echoes of hammering, phantom heat, guilt-heavy air
- Hazard: Unstable catwalks over 30ft drop to forge floor

**Key NPC: Ghost of Thalgrim Ironforge**
- **Race:** Dwarf (ghost)
- **Personality:** Tortured by guilt, seeks absolution
- **Knowledge:** Created the binding mechanism, knows how it works
- **Can be:** Negotiated with (Persuasion DC 15) or fought

**Negotiation Path:**
- Thalgrim: "I forged the chains that bind ten thousand souls. I deserve no peace."
- **Party Options:**
  - **Forgive him:** DC 15 Persuasion - he gives Shard willingly, fades peacefully
  - **Condemn him:** He attacks in rage
  - **Seek understanding:** DC 13 Insight - learn full story, he becomes ally

**If Negotiation Succeeds (Forgiveness Path):**
- Thalgrim explains: Demon army was breaking through, souls volunteered (mostly)
- Some souls were criminals forced into service
- Binding was supposed to be temporary (failed)
- He gives Shard and warning: "Opening the Vault without preparation will doom you"
- Thalgrim: "Thank you... I can finally rest."
- He fades peacefully (no combat)
- **Flag set:** `thalgrim_forgiven = true`
- **Memory Echo:** As the Shard touches your hand, you feel Thalgrim's relief wash over you—800 years of guilt finally released. His gratitude lingers like warmth.

**If Negotiation Succeeds (Understanding Path):**
- Same as above, but Thalgrim becomes available for consultation
- He gives Shard and becomes ally spirit
- No forgiveness flag (party sought knowledge, not absolution)

**If Combat Occurs:**

**Encounter: Thalgrim's Wrath**
- **Enemy:** Ghost of Thalgrim (CR 4, 1,100 XP) + 3x Animated Armor (CR 1, 200 XP each)
- **Adjusted XP:** (1,100 + 600) × 2 = 3,400 XP (Deadly for 4 Level 5 PCs)
- **Tactics:** Ghost possesses party members, armor provides physical threat
- **Environment:** Catwalks can collapse (DC 13 Dex save), forge equipment can be used

**Complication: The Forge Guardians**

After obtaining Shard (either method):

**Encounter: Helmed Horrors**
- **Enemies:** 3x Helmed Horror (CR 4, 1,100 XP each)
- **Adjusted XP:** 3,300 × 2 = 6,600 XP (DEADLY)
- **Escape Option:** Party can flee, horrors guard but don't pursue
- **Alternative:** DC 16 Arcana check to deactivate them (Shard acts as key)

**Loot:**
- **The Soulforge Shard** (key fragment)
- Masterwork smithing tools (500gp value)
- 1d3 +1 weapons (party choice)
- Thalgrim's journal (lore about binding)

**Fragment 1 Complete:** 1500 XP + Soulforge Shard acquired

---

#### **FRAGMENT 2: The Warden's Sigil**
**Location: Temple District | 1500 XP**

**Summary:** The Temple of Moradin holds the Warden's Sigil, which grants command authority over the bound souls. The high priest's spirit guards it, testing the party's worthiness.

**Location Details:**

**Temple of Moradin**
- Architecture: Massive stone cathedral, vaulted ceilings, altar intact
- Atmosphere: Sacred but corrupted, divine magic fading
- Feature: Altar still holds faint consecration (undead suffer disadvantage)

**Key NPC: Spirit of High Priest Durin Soulkeeper**
- **Race:** Dwarf (incorporeal spirit, not hostile ghost)
- **Personality:** Wise, weary, determined to protect Sigil
- **Knowledge:** Knows full truth of binding, tests party's intent
- **Cannot be fought:** Incorporeal, immune to damage

**The Trial of Intent:**

Durin manifests and speaks:
> "You seek the Warden's Sigil. Why? To free the souls? To command them? To claim power? Speak true, for I read hearts."

**Party must answer honestly (DC 16 Insight to discern Durin's test):**

**Answer 1: "To free the souls"**
- Durin: "Noble. But freeing them unleashes the breach. Ten thousand die to save ten thousand. Is this justice?"
- Test: Party must prove they understand the cost (Wisdom check DC 14)

**Answer 2: "To seal the breach permanently"**
- Durin: "Wise. But the souls suffer eternal agony. Will you sacrifice them for the world?"
- Test: Party must show they can bear the weight (Constitution save DC 14 - metaphorical)

**Answer 3: "To find a better solution"**
- Durin: "Ambitious. For 800 years we searched. What makes you different?"
- Test: Party must demonstrate creativity (Intelligence check DC 15 or novel idea)

**Answer 4: "For power"**
- Durin: "Honest. And terrible. You shall not have it."
- **Combat begins**

**If Party Passes Test:**
- Durin: "You understand the burden. The Sigil is yours. Use it wisely. Remember: command of souls is slavery, even in noble cause."
- Gives Sigil willingly
- **Bonus:** Durin becomes available for consultation (can ask him questions about Vault)
- **Flag set:** `durin_respected = true`
- **Memory Echo:** The Sigil pulses with Durin's conviction. For a moment, you see through his eyes—the terrible choice, the weight of duty. He trusts you understand.

**If Party Fails Test (or chooses power):**

**Encounter: The Warden's Judgment**
- **Summons:** 2x Will-o'-Wisp (CR 2, 450 XP each) + 1x Flameskull (CR 4, 1,100 XP)
- **Adjusted XP:** (900 + 1,100) × 2 = 4,000 XP (Deadly for 4 Level 5 PCs)
- **Tactics:** Will-o'-wisps drain life, flameskull casts from distance
- **Environment:** Consecrated ground (advantage on saves vs undead)
- **Sigil Location:** Behind altar, requires solving puzzle (DC 14 Investigation)

**Puzzle: The Three Choices Lock**

Altar has three dwarven statues representing:
1. **Justice** (sword)
2. **Mercy** (open hand)
3. **Wisdom** (book)

**Correct answer:** Press all three simultaneously (no one answer is correct alone)
- Represents: Balance of considerations in impossible choice
- Alternative: DC 16 Thieves' Tools to bypass

**Loot:**
- **The Warden's Sigil** (key fragment)
- Blessed symbol of Moradin (functions as +1 holy symbol)
- 3x Potion of Greater Healing
- Durin's Testament (lore about binding ceremony)

**Fragment 2 Complete:** 1500 XP + Warden's Sigil acquired

---

#### **FRAGMENT 3: The Mourner's Tear**
**Location: Memorial Gardens | 1500 XP**

**Summary:** The Memorial Gardens were where families said farewell to the souls who volunteered. The Mourner's Tear—a crystallized teardrop—rests in the Garden's heart, guarded by sorrowful spirits.

**Location Details:**

**The Memorial Gardens**
- Architecture: Underground park, stone trees, memorial plaques
- Atmosphere: Overwhelming sadness, phantom sobbing, grief made manifest
- Feature: 10,000 memorial stones, each bearing a name

**Emotional Hazard: The Weight of Sorrow**
- All creatures entering must make DC 13 Wisdom save
- Failure: Disadvantage on attacks and ability checks (grief overwhelms)
- Success: Affected but functional
- **Remove Curse** or similar magic can negate

**Key NPC: The Mourner (Amalgam Spirit)**
- **Type:** Unique entity (ghost collective of 10,000 families)
- **Personality:** Grief incarnate, desperate for loved ones' release
- **Desire:** Wants party to free the bound souls
- **Threat:** Will attack if party refuses

**The Mourner's Plea:**

Spirit manifests, speaking with ten thousand voices:
> "You seek the Tear. You seek to open the Vault. Will you FREE them? Or leave them in eternal torment?"

**Party Responses:**

**Response 1: "Yes, we'll free them"**
- Mourner: "Thank you! THANK YOU! Take the Tear. Free our beloved!"
- Gives Tear willingly
- **Consequence:** Commits party to freeing souls (heavy pressure for Act 3)

**Response 2: "We need more information first"**
- Mourner: "More delays! 800 years of WAITING! But... if you truly seek wisdom..."
- DC 15 Persuasion: Mourner calms, gives Tear reluctantly
- Failure: Combat begins

**Response 3: "The seal must hold"**
- Mourner: "BETRAYERS! Like the priests! You doom them to suffer!"
- **Immediate combat**

**Response 4: "We'll find another way"**

**If Combat Occurs:**

**Encounter: The Mourner's Wrath**
- **Enemy:** The Mourner (CR 6, 2,300 XP) + 6x Wraith (CR 5, 1,800 XP each)
- **Adjusted XP:** EXTREME DEADLY (Use waves: 2 wraiths per round join)
- **Tactics:** Mourner drains life, wraiths create spawn, overwhelming grief
- **Environment:** Memorial stones provide cover, grief aura persists

**Alternative Solution: Compassionate Approach**

Party can attempt to comfort the Mourner:
- **Speak with the Dead** on memorial stones (hear families' messages)
- **Commune** or divine magic (connect with original spirits)
- **Performance/Persuasion DC 14:** Sing a dirge, honor the sacrifice

**Success grants:**
- Mourner calms, recognizes party's empathy
- Gives Tear willingly
- **Bonus:** Blessing of the Mourner (+1d6 to death saves for entire party)
- **Flag set:** `mourner_comforted = true`
- **Memory Echo:** The Tear is warm in your hand, pulsing with the sorrow of ten thousand families. But beneath the grief, you feel hope—the Mourner believes you will free them.

**Loot:**
- **The Mourner's Tear** (key fragment, crystallized)
- 10,000gp worth of memorial jewelry (can be sold, but feels wrong)

### **MAIN QUEST 3: Hunters in the Dark**
**Faction Confrontation | 2500 XP | Sessions 6-7**

**Summary:** Two hostile factions converge on Khar-Morkai: **House Shadowveil** (hunting Velryn) and **Aberrant Devourer scouts** (investigating the seal). The party must survive or negotiate with both.

**This quest has two encounters that can occur in either order.**

---

#### **ENCOUNTER A: House Shadowveil Ambush**
**If Velryn is with party**

**Setup:** Drow hunting party catches up to Velryn while party travels through necropolis streets.

**Drow Forces:**
- **Leader:** Zilvra Shadowveil (Velryn's former mentor, drow priestess)
- **Warriors:** 4x Drow Elite Warrior (CR 5, 1,800 XP each)
- **Mage:** 1x Drow Mage (CR 7, 2,900 XP)
- **Total:** 2,900 + 7,200 = 10,100 XP × 2.5 = 25,250 (IMPOSSIBLE - This is a scene, not killable)

**Scene: The Confrontation**

Zilvra steps forward:
> "Velryn Duskmere. Traitor to House Shadowveil. Your sentence is death. But The Spider Queen is merciful—surrender, and your companions may live."

**Velryn's Reaction (Based on Loyalty Score):**

**High Loyalty (+6 or higher):**
- "I'm done running. If you want me, you fight ALL of us."
- Stands with party, ready to fight to the death
- **Redemption path locked in**

**Medium Loyalty (0 to +5):**
- "I... I don't want you to die for me. Maybe I should..."
- Party can encourage her (DC 13 Persuasion) or let her surrender

**Low Loyalty (-1 or lower):**
- "This was always temporary. Good luck, surfacers."
- Attempts to surrender (party can stop her or let her go)

**Party Options:**

**Option 1: Fight (Suicidal)**
- Drow are CR 5-7, party is level 5-6
- **Outcome:** TPK likely unless very creative
- **Alternative:** Fight for 3 rounds, then intervention

**Option 2: Negotiate**
- DC 17 Persuasion to stall
- Zilvra: "Why do you protect her? She's drow. We're monsters. You know this."
- Can argue: Redemption possible, she's changed, The Spider Queen is wrong
- Success: Zilvra hesitates, gives 1 round to flee

**Option 3: Velryn Sacrifices Herself**
- She steps forward: "Let them go. Take me."
- Drow accept, begin to capture her
- **Party can attempt rescue (creates chase/rescue quest)**

**Option 4: Creative Solution**
- Use environment (collapsing tomb, undead intervention)
- DC 15 Investigation: Notice unstable ceiling
- DC 14 Athletics: Bring it down on drow (blocks, doesn't kill)

**Deus Ex Machina (If Party About to TPK):**

**Undead Intervention:**
- Wights and ghouls pour from tombs
- Sentinel Korag (if befriended): "This is HOLY ground! No battles!"
- Drow forced to retreat (don't want two-front war)
- Party escapes in chaos

**Outcomes:**

**Velryn Captured:**
- She's taken by drow (not killed—valuable hostage)
- **Side Quest Unlocked:** "Rescue Velryn" (Optional)
- Reputation: Velryn N/A (captured)
- Party guilt: Nightmare intensity +1

**Velryn Escapes with Party:**
- Drow retreat but vow return
- Velryn deeply grateful (reputation +3)
- Future benefits in Act 3

**Zilvra Negotiated With:**
- Temporary truce (48 hours)
- Drow agree not to interfere with Vault mission
- **In exchange:** Party must not free souls (drow want them contained)

**XP Reward:** 1,500 XP (for surviving, not killing)

---

#### **ENCOUNTER B: Aberrant Devourer Scouts**
**Always occurs regardless of Velryn**

**Setup:** Party encounters Aberrant Devourer expedition investigating the weakening seal.

**Aberrant Devourer Forces:**
- **Leader:** Xalaphex (Aberrant Devourer, CR 7, 2,900 XP)
- **Thralls:** 6x Blind Savage (CR 1/4, 50 XP each)
- **Pet:** 1x Intellect Devourer (CR 2, 450 XP)

**Initial Contact: Telepathic Communication**

Xalaphex speaks directly into party's minds:
> "Surface-dwellers. Curious. You seek the Vault, yes? So do we. The seal weakens. The souls scream. This interests the Colony."

**Aberrant Devourer Goals:**
- Study the soul-binding magic
- Potentially harvest the bound souls (10,000 brains = massive power)
- Prevent demon breach (practical, not altruistic)

**Negotiation Possible:**

**Aberrant Devourers are LAWFUL EVIL:**
- They keep agreements (logically beneficial)
- Respect intelligence and competence
- Disdain weakness and emotion

**Party Options:**

**Option 1: Attack on Sight**
- **Encounter:** Full combat
- **Enemies:** All listed above
- **Adjusted XP:** (2,900 + 300 + 450) × 2.5 = 9,125 (Deadly for 4 Level 6 PCs)
- **Tactics:** Xalaphex uses Mind Blast (DC 15 Int save, 4d8+4 damage, stunned 1 min)
- **Blind Savages:** Charge and overwhelm, protect Aberrant Devourer
- **Intellect Devourer:** Targets weakest Int character (tries to possess)

**Option 2: Negotiate Truce**
- DC 15 Persuasion or Intimidation
- Xalaphex: "We propose cooperation. You open Vault. We study mechanism. We share information."
- **Benefit:** Aberrant Devourers provide intel on Vault wards
- **Cost:** Must allow them to observe (they learn too much)

**Option 3: Compete for Information**
- Intelligence contest (DC 16 Arcana vs Xalaphex)
- Whoever wins gets first access to Vault knowledge
- Loser must retreat

**Option 4: Bluff and Flee**
- DC 14 Deception: Convince them party already opened Vault (fake news)
- Xalaphex investigates (buys party time)

**Combat Resolution:**

**If combat goes badly:**
- Xalaphex: "You are outmatched. Retreat or be consumed."
- Offers surrender terms: Party shares Vault knowledge, lives

**If party winning:**
- Xalaphex uses Plane Shift (self only) to escape
- Blind Savages fight to death (thralls)
- Intellect Devourer flees

**Outcomes:**

**Aberrant Devourers Eliminated:**
- +2,900 XP (full encounter)
- Loot: Xalaphex's research notes (Vault ward weakness)
- **Warning:** Elder Brain will send more eventually

**Truce Established:**
- +1,000 XP (negotiation success)
- Aberrant Devourers provide info: "Two wards protect Vault—physical and psychic"
- Reputation: aberrant_devourer_collective +2 (respected for competence)
- **Consequence:** Aberrant Devourers observe Act 3 finale (complication)

**Aberrant Devourers Scared Off:**
- +1,500 XP (intimidation success)
- Temporary reprieve (won't return until Act 3)

**World State Changes:**
```yaml
reputation_changes:
  drow_house_Shadowveil:
    range: -10 (hostile) to +2 (temporary truce)
  
  aberrant_devourer_collective:
    range: -8 (attacked) to +4 (cooperation)

  - zilvra_confronted: true

companion_loyalty:
  velryn: +3 (if defended) or N/A (if captured)
```

### **MAIN QUEST 4: The Outer Sanctum**
**Act Finale | 3000 XP | Sessions 8-9**

**Summary:** With all three key fragments, the party approaches the Vault's outer sanctum beneath the central spire. Final guardians await, and the full horror of the binding is revealed.

**Location: The Descent to the Vault**

**The Central Spire (Interior)**
- Spiral stairs descending 1 mile underground
- Walls carved with 10,000 names (the bound souls)
- Temperature drops, nightmare intensity peaks
- Psychic whispers: pleas, warnings, accusations

**Environmental Challenge: The Descent**

As party descends:
- **Madness Risk:** DC 14 Wisdom save every 10 minutes or gain short-term madness
- **Exhaustion:** DC 12 Constitution save or gain 1 exhaustion (descent takes 4 hours)
- **Phantoms:** Manifestations of bound souls (not hostile, just haunting)

**Companions React:**

**Velryn (if present):**
- "Gods... this is worse than I imagined. Are we doing the right thing?"
- Opportunity for roleplay, party can reassure her

**Gralk (if present):**
- "This is beyond us. We should turn back."
- Tests party's resolve

**Midpoint Encounter: The Guilt Guardians**

**Encounter: Manifestation of Regret**
- **Enemies:** 4x Allip (CR 5, 1,800 XP each) - psychic undead
- **Adjusted XP:** 7,200 × 2 = 14,400 (Deadly for 4 Level 6 PCs)
- **Tactics:** Psychic screams, drain intelligence, create babbling madness
- **Environment:** Narrow spiral stairs (falling is 20ft between landings)
- **Can be avoided:** DC 16 Stealth check (entire party)

**The Outer Sanctum Chamber**

Finally reaching bottom:

**Description:**
> *A vast circular chamber carved from black obsidian. Three pedestals stand in a triangle, each with a keyhole shaped like your fragments. In the center, a massive adamantine door sealed with glowing runes. Beyond it, you FEEL the souls—10,000 minds screaming in unison. The Vault lies beyond.*

**The Final Guardian: Durin's Champion**

**Encounter: Animated Colossus**
- **Enemy:** Stone Golem (CR 10, 5,900 XP)
- **Modified:** Has 200 HP (boosted), represents Durin's will
- **Adjusted XP:** 5,900 (Deadly for 4 Level 6 PCs, VERY hard)
- **Tactics:** Slow Action (DC 17 Wisdom save), crushing blows (20+ damage)
- **Weakness:** Vulnerable to adamantine weapons (if party has one)
- **Environment:** 3 pillars provide cover, can collapse them on golem (DC 15 Athletics)

**Alternative Bypasses (Multiple Paths):**

**PATH 1: Reputation (Original)**
If party has **khar_morkai_undead reputation +4 or higher:**
- Durin's spirit appears: "You have proven worthy. The Colossus stands down."
- No combat needed

**PATH 2: Compassion (New)**
If party has **2 or more compassion flags** (thalgrim_forgiven, durin_respected, mourner_comforted):
- The Colossus raises its fist... then hesitates.
- **The guardians speak through it:**

> *Thalgrim's voice (if forgiven):* "They showed mercy. They gave me peace."
> *Durin's voice (if respected):* "They understand sacrifice. They are worthy."
> *Mourner's voice (if comforted):* "They see us. They remember us. Let them pass."

- The Colossus lowers its fist and steps aside.
- **No combat needed**
- **Party feels the gratitude of three souls finally at peace**

**PATH 3: Combat (If neither bypass)**
If party lacks both reputation and compassion flags:
- Full Colossus combat encounter (see stats above)
- Stone Golem (CR 10, 5,900 XP)
- Tactics: Slow Action (DC 17 Wisdom save), crushing blows
- Weakness: Adamantine weapons, collapsing pillars

**Using the Three Keys:**

Party places fragments in pedestals:
1. **Soulforge Shard** (left)
2. **Warden's Sigil** (right)
3. **Mourner's Tear** (center)

**Activation Sequence:**
- Runes glow brighter
- Psychic pressure intensifies (DC 15 Wisdom save or stunned 1 round)
- Door's outer seal breaks
- **Inner sanctum now accessible (Act 3)**

**The Revelation:**

As door opens partially, visions flood party's minds:

**Vision: The Binding Ceremony (800 years ago)**
- Volunteers step forward (some willing, some forced)
- Priests chant binding ritual
- Souls scream as they're ripped from bodies and imprisoned
- Demon breach sealed... for now
- Thane Durin: "May Moradin forgive us. It's the only way."

**Party learns:**
- Binding was horrific even for willing volunteers
- Souls are conscious, suffering every moment for 800 years
- Seal is weakening (hence nightmares)
- If seal breaks: The Rot Goddess's demon army invades Underdark, spreads to surface
- If souls are freed without replacement: Same result

**The Impossible Truth:**
- There's no clean solution
- Free souls = demon apocalypse
- Keep them bound = eternal torture
- Use their power = become the monster
- Find alternative = requires maximum reputation + sacrifice (Act 3)

#### Quest Completion

**Act 2 Ends With:**
- All three keys acquired
- Outer sanctum reached
- Final guardians defeated/bypassed
- Full truth revealed
- Party at threshold of Vault
- **Level Up:** Party should now be Level 7

**Rewards:**
- 3,000 XP (split among party)
- Vault outer doors opened
- All context for Act 3 decision

## 🎭 DM GUIDANCE

### **Pacing Advice**

**Session 1-2:** Khar-Morkai orientation, establish base, begin fragment hunt
**Session 3-4:** First key fragment (player's choice of which)
**Session 5:** Second key fragment
**Session 6:** Third key fragment + faction encounter (drow OR Aberrant Devourers)
**Session 7:** Second faction encounter + side quests
**Session 8-9:** Descent to Outer Sanctum, Colossus fight, revelation

*Adjust based on party's exploration choices and side quest engagement*

### **Key Moments to Emphasize**

**The Impossible Truth:**
- When party learns full story, let it sink in
- No quick solutions
- Companions react with horror
- This is the campaign's moral core

**Velryn's Arc:**
- If she's captured, make rescue urgent
- If she's defended, make her gratitude profound
- Her loyalty score determines Act 3 sacrifice

**Environmental Horror:**
- 10,000 names everywhere
- Constant whispers
- Beautiful but terrible
- Guilt made physical

### **Common Pitfalls**

**Pitfall 1:** Party tries to find "the answer"
- **Reality:** There isn't one
- All solutions have costs
- That's the point

**Pitfall 2:** Party speed-runs to Vault
- **Solution:** Environmental challenges slow them
- Fragments take time
- Factions force encounters

**Pitfall 3:** Velryn captured with no rescue
- **Consequence:** Party feels railroaded
- **Solution:** Always provide rescue option
- Make it hard but possible

### **Moral Complexity Management**

**Not Grimdark:**
- Small mercies matter (Mara's message)
- Companions provide hope
- Beauty exists (Memorial Gardens)
- Heroism possible (just costly)

**Trolley Problem:**
- Free souls → demon apocalypse → more deaths
- Keep souls bound → 10,000 suffer eternally
- Neither is "correct"
- Party's choice defines them

### **Faction Balance**

**Drow vs Aberrant Devourers:**
- Both are threats
- Neither is "the villain"
- Both have logical motivations
- Can negotiate with either
- Choices matter in Act 3

## 🔄 TRANSITION TO ACT 3

**Act 2 Ends When:**
- All three key fragments acquired
- Outer Sanctum reached
- Full truth revealed
- Level 7 achieved
- Companion loyalty tested
- Faction standings established

**Act 3 Setup:**

> *You stand at the threshold. The adamantine door looms before you, sealed with three locks now open. Beyond it, you FEEL them—10,000 souls screaming in unison. The Vault of Souls awaits.*
>
> *You know the truth now. Thane Durin and his priests made an impossible choice 800 years ago: condemn 10,000 souls to eternal torment, or let demons consume the world.*
>
> *The seal is failing. The nightmares prove it. Soon, the choice will remake itself—but this time, YOU must choose.*
>
> *Behind you, Khar-Morkai broods. Drow lurk in shadows. Aberrant Devourers observe. The undead watch.*
>
> *Ahead lies the Vault. Four paths diverge. None are clean. All demand a price.*
>
> *What will you sacrifice?*
