## 📖 CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

### **Elevator Pitch**

The ancient dwarven necropolis of **Khar-Morkai** has been lost for centuries beneath the northern mountains. Recently, surface tremors and strange nightmares plaguing nearby settlements suggest something stirs in the deep. 

The party must descend into the brutal Underdark, navigate treacherous factions, and discover the terrible truth: ten thousand souls were deliberately imprisoned 800 years ago to seal a demonic breach. Now the seal weakens, the souls scream in torment, and an impossible choice awaits at the **Vault of Souls**.

No clean solutions exist. Every victory demands a price.
