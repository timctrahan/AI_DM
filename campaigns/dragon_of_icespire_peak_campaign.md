## 📖 CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

### Elevator Pitch

A young white dragon terrorizes the Sword Coast near Phandalin, forcing heroes to take on quests from the town's quest board to protect the region and eventually confront the wyrm in its mountain lair.

### Story Summary

After securing Wave Echo Cave and defeating the Black Spider, the heroes of Phandalin face a new threat: **Cryovain**, a young white dragon, has emerged from the Sword Mountains and begun terrorizing settlements across the region. The dragon attacks randomly, freezing victims and hoarding treasure in its lair at Icespire Hold.

Phandalin's citizens post quests on the town board, seeking aid with problems both related and unrelated to the dragon. As the party completes quests, they grow stronger, learn more about the dragon's patterns, and eventually discover its lair location. The campaign culminates in an assault on Icespire Hold to defeat Cryovain and end the terror.

Unlike a linear adventure, this is a **sandbox campaign** where players choose which quests to pursue and in what order (within level-appropriate ranges). The dragon threat creates urgency while allowing player agency in how they approach the problem.

### Connection to Other Campaigns

**Prerequisite Campaign**: Lost Mine of Phandelver (recommended but not required)  
**Sequel Campaigns**: Storm Lord's Wrath, Sleeping Dragon's Wake, Divine Contention

- Secured Wave Echo Cave

- Became partners with the Rockseeker brothers
- Established themselves as heroes of Phandalin
- Reached Level 3

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks after LMoP ends (optional time skip for Wave Echo Cave operations to begin)

## ⚙️ CAMPAIGN-SPECIFIC MECHANICS

### Dragon Threat System

**How It Works**:
The dragon threat escalates throughout the campaign, creating tension without railroading.

**Threat Levels**:

**Level 1 - Rumors** (Quests 1-3):
- NPCs mention dragon sightings
- Evidence of attacks (frozen corpses, burned buildings)
- No direct encounters
- Party hears stories

**Level 2 - Distant Encounters** (Quests 4-6):
- Party spots dragon flying in distance (no combat)
- Dragon flies over during quest (intimidation)
- Dragon attacks location AFTER party leaves
- Sense of danger building

**Level 3 - Direct Threat** (Quests 7-9):
- Dragon attacks during quest (not full combat, strafing run)
- Party must take cover or flee
- Dragon's breath weapon used from distance
- Real danger, but not meant to TPK

**Level 4 - Confrontation** (Dragon's Lair):
- Final battle

**Random Encounter Table** (Roll 1d20 when traveling):
- 1-15: No encounter
- 16-17: Dragon sighting (distant)
- 18: Dragon flyby (close, but doesn't attack)
- 19: Dragon strafing run (one breath weapon, then leaves)
- 20: Choose based on threat level

**Dragon Encounter Rules**:
- If encounter happens early (Levels 3-4): Dragon does flyby or breath weapon from 120+ feet, then leaves
- If encounter happens mid (Levels 4-5): Dragon strafes, does one pass, retreats
- Never force full combat until final lair encounter
- Dragon learns from encounters: if party hurts it, it becomes more cautious

**Purpose**:
- Create atmosphere of danger
- Make dragon feel present without forced combat
- Build to climactic final battle
- Allow party to damage dragon before final fight (reducing final HP if they score hits)

---

## 📊 PACING GUIDELINES

### Recommended Quest Order

**Phase 1: Introduction** (Sessions 1-3, Level 3)
1. Dwarven Excavation (warm-up)
2. Umbrage Hill (introduce dragon threat)
3. Gnomengarde (social encounter)

Builds confidence, establishes routine, low stakes.

---

**Phase 2: Escalation** (Sessions 4-10, Level 3-4)
4. Butterskull Ranch (first real challenge)
5. Loggers' Camp (environmental danger)
6. Mountain's Toe Mine (lycanthropy danger)

Difficulty increases, resources matter, dragon sightings begin.

---

**Phase 3: High Stakes** (Sessions 11-17, Level 4-5)
7. Falcon's Hunting Lodge (undead corruption from dragon)
8. Circle of Thunder (dragon influence on region)
9. Shrine of Savras (discover lair location)

Dragon encounters more frequent, party prepares for final fight.

---

**Phase 4: Climax** (Sessions 18-20, Level 5-6)
10. Dragon's Lair (final battle)

Epic conclusion.

---

### Flexible Sequencing

**Must Be Done in Order**:
- Shrine of Savras before Dragon's Lair (reveals location)

**Recommended But Flexible**:
- Easy quests (1-3) before medium quests (4-6)
- Medium quests before hard quests (7-9)

**Completely Flexible**:
- Any quest within same difficulty tier

**DM Adjustments**:
- If party does hard quest too early: Add warning NPCs, adjust encounter difficulty down
- If party does easy quest too late: Add more enemies or environmental challenges

---

### Level Progression

**Using XP** (recommended):

| After Quest | Total XP | Level Reached |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Quest 1 | ~300 | Still 3 (need 2,700) |
| Quest 2 | ~650 | Still 3 |
| Quest 3 | ~1,050 | Still 3 |
| Quest 4 | ~1,750 | Still 3 |
| Quest 5 | ~2,650 | Still 3 |
| Quest 6 | ~3,450 | **Level 4** |
| Quest 7 | ~4,850 | Level 4 |
| Quest 8 | ~6,050 | Level 4 |
| Quest 9 | ~7,150 | **Level 5** |
| Dragon Fight | ~10,550 | Level 5 (close to 6) |

**Using Milestones** (alternative):
- **Level 4**: After completing 3 quests (any tier)
- **Level 5**: After completing 6 quests total
- **Level 6**: After defeating dragon

- Sandbox structure: players choose quests
- Dragon is real, dangerous threat
- Combat-focused but roleplay opportunities exist
- Expected to reach Level 6 by campaign end

**Character Continuity** (if from LMoP):

- **Starting Level**: 3
- **Ability Scores**: Standard array, point buy, or rolling (DM choice)

---

### House Rules Discussion

- Inspiration for good roleplay

---

### Opening Scene

**How Campaign Begins**:

*For LMoP Continuation*:
"It's been three weeks since you secured Wave Echo Cave and defeated the Black Spider. The Rockseeker brothers have begun mining operations, and Phandalin is thriving. You've been resting and enjoying your newfound fame when troubling news arrives: a white dragon has been spotted in the mountains, and settlements are being attacked. Harbin Wester has set up a quest board in the town square, seeking heroes to help protect the region. You stand before the board now, reading the available quests..."

*For Fresh Start*:
"You arrive in Phandalin, a small frontier town recently rebuilt after years of trouble. The townmaster, Harbin Wester, has hired you to help protect the region from a new threat: a young white dragon terrorizing the area. A quest board has been set up in the town square, and several urgent requests are already posted..."

## ✅ CAMPAIGN COMPLETION

### Standard Ending

**Dragon Defeated**:
The party defeats Cryovain, claims its hoard, and returns to Phandalin as legendary heroes. The region is safe, settlements can rebuild, and trade resumes. The party is celebrated with a grand feast and offered positions of honor in Phandalin's leadership.

**Immediate Results**:
- Cryovain dead, threat eliminated
- Dragon hoard claimed
- Phandalin throws celebration
- Party reaches Level 6 (or close)
- Fame spreads across Sword Coast

**Long-Term Impact**:
- Region prospers without dragon threat
- Wave Echo Cave and other mines operate safely
- Icespire Hold becomes landmark
- Party's legend grows

---

### Alternative Endings

**Dragon Escapes**:
If Cryovain flees during final battle (reduced to 25% HP, successfully escapes), it will eventually return. Party must hunt it down or prepare for its revenge.

**Dragon Diplomacy** (unlikely but possible):
If party somehow negotiates with Cryovain (extremely high DC Charisma checks, convincing arguments), dragon might agree to relocate or reduce attacks in exchange for regular tribute.

---

### Failure State

**Total Party Kill**:
Cryovain remains threat, terrorizes region. Phandalin eventually falls or is abandoned. Dragon's legend grows.

**Party Retreats**:
If party flees from dragon's lair, Cryovain becomes more aggressive, launches attack on Phandalin itself. Party must defend town in urban combat scenario.

---

### Sequel Hooks

**Storm Lord's Wrath**: 
Talos cultists heard of party's dragon-slaying prowess and seek to test their mettle against greater threats.

**Homebrew Continuations**:
- Ancient dragon allies of Cryovain seek revenge
- Zhentarim (via Halia) offer bigger contracts
- Harpers (via Garaele) recruit party for critical mission
- Another dragon (Cryovain's parent?) investigates offspring's death

---

### Character Futures

**Level 6 Adventurers**:
- Can take leadership roles in Phandalin
- Sought after for dangerous quests region-wide
- Build strongholds or businesses
- Train next generation of heroes
