**We return to the game.** The party has completed its investigation of Thornhearth and now stands in the Iron Hearth Inn.

**What is the next action for the party?**

1.  **Report to Elder Miriam:** Return to the Town Square to update the Elder on the true nature of the threat (Khar-Morkai, a deliberate breach) and collect the initial payment before descending.
2.  **Scout the Mine Entrance:** Proceed directly to the **Old Mine Entrance** to look for the Drow's tracks and assess the immediate entry point.
3.  **Confront Dorvin:** Return to the forge and ask Dorvin if he saw the Drow scout near the mine entrance a week ago.
4.  **Cast a Spell (Scrying):** Aldric prepares to use his Level 5 slot to cast *Scrying* on "the Drow scout who entered the mine," attempting to locate them and see what they are doing now.
